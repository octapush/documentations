# Basic Knowledge

Basically **`octapush.docs`** is a file explorer with a preview file feature (especially for markdown files, images, and markup) for your repository located on GitHub. So, any changes whatsoever happens to your files on your GitHub repository, it will be updated automatically on **`octapush.docs`**.

For those of you who are used to using GitHub as a repository, you can skip this section.

In this tutorial sub-section, I will only show you how to [Create Document](#/05.Documenting/02.Create%20Document.md), [Edit Document](#/05.Documenting/03.Edit%20Document.md), and [Delete Document](#/05.Documenting/04.Delete%20Document.md) via GitHub only.

For those of you who want to deepen syntax-syntax markdown, you can see it in _**Refferences > Mastering Markdown**_ sessions on the side menu.
