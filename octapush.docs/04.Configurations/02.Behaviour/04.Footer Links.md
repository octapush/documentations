# Footer Links Configuration

On this page I will explain how to change (add, edit, delete) the links contained in the footer page of **`octapush.docs`**.

![configs.js configurations](https://cdn.rawgit.com/octapush/documentations/5e256c2a/octapush.docs/00.ASSETS/images/configs-js-behave-footer-links.png)

As you can see in the picture above, there are three links I give to the configuration, ie Author, octapush Projects, and download.

All three links you can modify (add, edit, delete) as you like by paying attention to the rules as follows:

- When modifying this configuration make sure all links are contained in the square brackets `[ ]`.
- And for each link you want to display, use the curly brackets `{ }` and separated by commas for each link.

ConfigName  | Descriptions
----------: | ------------
_**title**_ | Used as **title** to be displayed.
_**url**_   | Used as the target address of the link.
