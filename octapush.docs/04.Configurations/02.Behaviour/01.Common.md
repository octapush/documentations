# Common Configurations

On this page I will explain how to configure the **`octapush.docs`** application behavior.

 ![configs.js configurations](https://cdn.rawgit.com/octapush/documentations/09344e6b/octapush.docs/00.ASSETS/images/configs-js-behave-common.png)

 As seen in the picture above, there are five configurations that can be adjusted according to your needs and desires, here is an explanation of each configuration above:

ConfigName                      | Descriptions
------------------------------: | ------------
_**applicationTitleCase**_      | Used to set the **Title** text case in the browser. The values that you can use in this configuration are:<br /><br />`as-is`: To display the form letter writing as is, according to the form you write.<br /><br />`capitalize`: To display the form of capital writing..<br /><br />`uppercase`: Used to display the form of writing with all capital letters.<br /><br />`lowercase`: Used to display the form of writing with all lowercase.
_**docTitleType**_              | Used to set the **Title** to be displayed in the browser. The values that you can use in this configuration are:<br /><br />`app`: By using this value, then the caption in the browser will only show the name of the application only.<br /><br />`page`: By using this value, then the caption in the browser will only display the name of the active page.<br /><br />`combine`: By using this value, the browser caption will display the name of the application and the name of the active page.
_**docTitleCombineSeparator**_  | Is a character that will be used as a title delimiter character. You can use whatever character you want.<br /><br />**Note :**<br />This feature will only be active if the _**docTitleType**_ configuration uses the `combine` value only.
_**openExternalLinkOnNewTab**_  | If the value is `true` then any external links will be opened through a new tab. Conversely, if the value `false` then the external link will be opened on the same tab and overwrite **`octapush.docs`** window.
_**scrollSpeed**_               | This configuration is used to set _speed_ animation when the user clicks on a link that links to the anchor component.<br /><br />The value used in this configuration is a numeric value with milliseconds. The greater the value used, the slower the movement of animation.
