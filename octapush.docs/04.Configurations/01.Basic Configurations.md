# Basic Configurations

**`octapush.docs`** has many configurations that you can customize to suit different needs and views. However, on this page, I will only discuss how to configure **`octapush.docs`** fundamentally. The main discussion on this page is the technique of initializing octapush.docs to be able to display your files that are in the GitHub repository.

There are two files you can configure, the **index.html** and **configs.js** files (for those of you who are developers, of course, can open other files).

### **index.html**
First, we will discuss the configuration in the **index.html** file. Unless you're a web developer, there's not much configuration you need to do on this page, which is actually still configurable through the configs.js file.

Open the **index.html** file using the text editor, whose contents are more or less like in the following figure:

In the picture above, there are three main points you need to note (marked with a red box), namely:

- **title :** Is used to set the application title or title of your documentation on a web browser.

- **data-background-color :** Used to set the background color on the side menu. There are two colors that you can use: `brown` and `white`.

- **data-active-color :** Used to set the text color on the side menu. There are five text colors that you can use: `primary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `danger`.

### **configs.js**
The basic configuration you need to do to ensure your documentation can be displayed by **`octapush.docs`** is by configuring configuration in the **configs.js** file.

See the following picture:

There are some basic configuration points you can set to make sure your documentation files can be loaded by **`octapush.docs`**, which include:

ConfigName                      | Descriptions
------------------------------: | ------------
_**title**_                     | Is used to set the application title or title of your documentation on a web browser.
_**githubData > owner**_        | Is the owner of the github repository that will be binded inside **`octapush.docs`**.
_**githubData > project**_      | Is the name of your project on the GitHub repository.
_**githubData > branch**_       | Is a branch that will be loaded by **`octapush.docs`**.
_**githubData > docDirectory**_ | Is the name of the directory that will load the files.

See the following figure for detailed information on the GitHub data you need.

**Tips :**
- For those of you who have never used GitHub, you can see  [git/github guide by Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/).
- For text editors, we recommend the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Many plugins that can facilitate you in processing the documentation files, which include the plugin GitHub Repository, Markdown Preview plugin, and so forth.
