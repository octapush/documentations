Raw images from the repo can be used by calling them directly.:

```text
![Alt Text](https://github.com/(user)/(repo)/raw/master/path/to/image.gif)
```

All images are cached on GitHub, so if your host goes down, the image will remain available.

As you may have noticed, images in Markdown are very similar to links. The difference is that:
- the square brackets must be prefixed with an exclamation mark and
- inside they may have some alternative text. A description of the image, which is displayed if the image can't be loaded.
